   # theMansion is a pool of collections, that includes:

   - malwares
   - exploits
   - POC's
   - as well as other resources such as links to other collections & users (on GitHub & others)


    --Note--
    It should be obvious, but I do not take any risks.
    
    This message here is only going to tell you this:
    "Always exercise extreme caution when working with malwares, 
     or when visiting any site with malware-dedicated material, 
     in case of an accidental Download and / or run of a malware. Although unlikely - it **could** happen.
     Especially sites which are not GitHub."
